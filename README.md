# DeepFake-Facial-Recognition-Detection
DeepFake Facial Recognition/Detection

Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with this simple Deepfake facial recognition/Detection code.

I built it using ageitgey/face recognition library and the dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning.
The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.

This also provides face_recognition command line tool that lets you do face recognition on a folder of images from the command line.
